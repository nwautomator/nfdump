.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the flow data from one or more binary files, created by any nfdump collector
.Ar nfcapd, nfpcapd
and
.Ar sfcapd .
It processes and lists the flows in many different output formats and can create a wide
range of statistics.
.Pp
.Nm
has a very powerful flow filter to process flows. The filter syntax is very similar
to tcpdump, but adapted and extended for flow filtering. A flow filter may also contain
arrays of many thousand IP addresses etc. to search for specific records.
.Pp
.Nm
can aggreagte flows according to a user defined number of elements. This masks certain
elements and allows to sum up flow records matching the same values.
.Pp
The combination of flow filtering and aggregation as input for any flow statistics
allows complex flow processing. Pre-filtered and aggregated flow data may also be
written back into a binary flow file, which again may be processed with
.Nm
.Pp
.Nm
can enrich the listing of flows with geo location information and AS information,
unless AS information is already available in the flow records. IP addresses can be
tagged with a two letter country code, or with a longer location label containing
the geographic region, country and city.  The geo location and AS information is
retrieved from the optional
.Ar geoDB
database, created by the
.Ar geolookup
program from the nfdump tools.
.Ar geolookup
uses the
.Ar Maxmind
database
.Ar GeoDB
or
.Ar GeoLite2
to create a binary lookup database for
.Nm
Please check the
.Ar geolooup(1)
man page for more details.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl r Ar flowpath
Reads flow records from this path.
.Ar flowpath
may be a single file, or a directory containing any number of flow files or sub
directories.  All files are processed in the order, as listed by the OS.
.It Fl w Ar outfile
Writes all processed records into
.Ar outfile
instead of printing. The
.Ar flowfile
is a binary flow file and may be processed again with
.Nm
This can be useful to limit flows according to a flow filter and/or specific flow
aggregation.
.It Fl f Ar filterfile
Reads the flow filter from
.Ar filterfile.
This can be useful for very long or structured filters, with comments and long lists.
.Ar Note:
Any filter specified directly on the command line takes precedence over the
.Ar filterfile.
.It Fl C Ar config
Read more options from file
.Ar config.
.Nm
tries to read by default
.Ar %prefix/etc/nfdump.conf.
This may be overwritten by the environment variable
.Ar NFCONF
which again may be overwritten by this option
.Fl C.
In order to prevent reading any config file, even if it would exist set
.Fl C
.Sy none.
A config file is not required, but may be handy for often used output formats etc.
.It Fl O Ar order
Sets an output order for records to be printed as text output. This order applies
after all records processing, such as filtering, and aggregation and before printing.
.Bl -tag -width "duration" -compact
.It Cm flows
Sort according to the number of flows
.It Cm packets
Sort according to (in)packets
.It Cm ipkg

.El
.It Fl t Ar timewin
Set time window to process flows. This option is considered legacy and may be replaced
with a
.Ar filter
primitive
in future releases. The time window is specified as: YYYY/MM/dd.hh:mm:ss[-YYYY/MM/dd.hh:mm:ss].
Any parts of the time spec may be omitted e.g YYYY/MM/dd expands to YYYY/MM/dd.00:00:00-infinity
and processes all flow from a given day onwards. 
.It Fl c Ar num
Limit the number of records to be processed to the first
.Ar num
records, which passwd the
.Ar filter.
.It Fl a
Aggregate flow records. The default aggregation is done at connection level by taking the 5-tuple
.Ar protocol, srcip, dstip, srcport
and
.Ar dstport.
This way of aggregation may be overwritten by option
.Fl A
.It Fl A Ar aggregation
Sets the list of elements in a flow record to be aggregated.
.Ar aggregation
is a ',' separated list of any number of v9/ipfix elements. The following elements are accepted:
.Bl -tag -width "srcip4/net" -compact
.It Cm proto
IP protocol
.It Cm srcip
Source IP address
.It Cm dstip
Destination IP address
.It Cm srcip4/net

.El
.Pp
.Nm
automatically compiles the appropriate output format for the selected aggregation elements
unless an explicit output format
.Fl o
is given. The automatic output format is identical to
.Pp
.Dl -o 'fmt:%ts %td <fields> %pkt %byt %bps %bpp %fl'
.Pp
where <fields> represents the selected aggregation tags.
.It Fl b
Aggregate flow records as bidirectional flows. This automatically implies -a.  Aggregation
is done on connection level by taking the 5-tuple
.Ar protocol, srcip, dstip, srcport
and
.Ar dstport
The reverse order applies for the corresponding reverse flow. Input and output packets/bytes
are counted and reported separately. Both flows are merged into a single record with corresponding
input and output counters. An appropriate output format is selected automatically, which may be
overwritten by any
.Fl o Ar format
option.
.It Fl B
Similar to option
.Fl b
but tries to guess the correct client to server direction. Automagically swaps flows if
src port is < dst port for TCP and UDP flows and src port < 1024 and dst port > 1024.
Some exporters do not really care sending the flows in proper order.
It's considered to be a conveniency option.
.It Fl I
Print flow statistics of a single file or the summary of all the files specified by
.Fl r Ar flowpath.
.It Fl g
Print for each flow file given by
.Fl r Ar flowpath
a one line summary, which can be easily used by gnu plot.
.It Fl D Ar nameserver
Sets the
.Ar nameserver
to translate hostnames into IP addresses in filter expressions. See
.Ar filter
below for more details.
.It Fl G Ar geoDB
Use
.Ar geoDB
as geo lookup DB for geo location and AS lookups.
.Nm
tries to read the environment variable
.Ar NFGEODB
for the path of
.Ar geoDB.
The option
.Fl G
overwrites
.Ar NFGEODB
or
.Ar geodb.path 
in
.Ar nfdump.conf.
In order to prevent reading any
.Ar geoDB
file, even if it would exist set
.Fl G
.Sy none.
See also
.Ar geolookup(1)
.It Fl H Ar torDB
Use
.Ar torDB
as tor lookup DB for tor exit node lookups.
.Nm
tries to read the environment variable
.Ar NFTORDB
for the path of
.Ar torDB.
The option
.Fl H
overwrites
.Ar NFTORDB
or
.Ar tordb.path
in
.Ar nfdump.conf.
In order to prevent reading any
.Ar torDB
file, even if it would exist set
.Fl H
.Sy none.
See also
.Ar torlookup(1)
.It Fl s Ar statistic Op Ar :p Op Ar /orderby
Generate the Top N flow record or flow element statistic. By optionally adding
.Sy :p
to
.Ar statistic,
the statistic is additionally split up into the transport layer protocols.
By default the statistic is transport protocol independent.
Each
.Ar statistic
may be ordered by the optional parameter
.Ar orderby
This can be
.Sy flows, packets, bytes, pps, bps
or
.Sy bpp.
You may specify more than one
.Ar orderby
option, which results in the same statistic but ordered differently. If no orderby
is given, the statistic is ordered by flows. You can specify as many -s flow element
statistics as needed on the command line for the same run.

.Pp
.It Fl n Ar num
Set the number of records to be printed to
.Ar num.
This option applies to
.Fl s
statistics as well as to ordered output
.Fl O or aggregated records
.Fl a
The default is set to 10 for statistics and unlimited for the other use cases. To disable the limit, set
.Ar num
to 0.
.It Fl o Ar format
Sets the output format to print flow records.
.Nm has many different output formats already predefined.
.Ar format may be one of the options below:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "extended " -compact
.It Cm raw
Print the full flow record on multiple lines. This prints all available information.
.It Cm fmt: Ar user
Print the flow records according the format
.Ar user.
This is a very flexible and powerful way to format flow records. See the section
.Sy OUTPUT
below for more details on how to compile your own format.
.It Cm csv: Ar user
Print the flow records as user defined csv format. Use a ',' separated list of
.Ar user
defined output token compatible with
.Ar fmt
format. See the section
.Sy OUTPUT
below for more details on how to compile your own csv format.
.It Cm json
Print full record as a separate json object.
.It Cm ndjson
Print full record as a one line json object, sepatated by newline. Suitable for log processors such as logstash.
.It Cm csv
Print reocrd in csv format - format compatible to fmt
.Sy line
format. 
.It Cm csv-fast
Replaces old pipe format. Basic record information only. Fast implementation.
.El
.Pp
Already predefined fmt formats:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "extended" -compact
.It Cm line
Print each flow on one line. Default format.
.It Cm long
Print each flow on one line with more details
.It Cm biline
Same as
.Ar line,
but for bi-directional flows
.It Cm bilong
Same as
.Ar long,
but for bi-directional flows
.It Cm gline
Same as
.Ar line,
but add country code to IPs. If a geoDB file is supplied
this is the default output format
.It Cm glong
Same as
.Ar long,
but add country code to IPs
.It Cm extended
Print each flow on one line with even more details.
.It Cm nsel
Print format for NSEL event records. Default format if NSEL/NAT
support has been compiled in.
.It Cm nel
Print format for NAT event records.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
config file may contain additional formats. If you want to add new formats or
change existing ones, check the config file.
.Pp
IPv6 addresses are printed condensed in any
.Sy fmt
defined format to prevent cluttering the output with large blank blocks. A condensed IPV6 uses max 16 characters. If it is
longer, then the middle part of the IP is cut out and replaced be "..". For previewing an output, this fits most needs.
For a listing with the full IPV6 addresses add option
.Fl 6.
.It Fl 6
Print full length of IPv6 addresses in output instead of condensed.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode. Suppress the header line and the statistics at the bottom of text outputs.
.It Fl N
Print plain numbers in output without scaling. Easier for output parsing with 3rd party tools.
.It Fl i Ar ident
Change the ident label in the file, specified by
.Fl r
to
.Ar ident
.It Fl v Ar flowfile
Verify the consistency of
.Ar flowfile
and print the file parameters and number of records.
.It Fl E Ar flowfile
Print the exporter and sampler list if found in
.Ar flowfile.
Additional statistics per exporter are printed with number of flows, packets and sequence errors.
.It Fl x Ar flowfile
This options works on nfdump version 1.6.x files only and may get removed in future.
Scans and prints extension maps located in
.Ar flowfile
.It Fl z=lzo
Compress flow files with LZO1X-1 compression. Fastest compression.
.It Fl z=bz2
Compress flow files with bz2 compression. Slow but most efficient. May be used
for archiving files or if you are really short of spce.
.It Fl z=lz4[:level]
Compress flow files with LZ4 compression. Fast and efficient. Optional level should be between 1..10
Changing the level results in smaller files but uses up more time to compress. Levels > 5 may need more
workers. See -W.
.It Fl z=zstd[:level]
Compress flow files with ZSTD compression. Fast and efficient. Optional level should be between 1..10
Changing the level results in smaller files but uses up more time to compress. Levels > 5 may need more
workers. See -W.
.It Fl W Ar num
Sets the number of workers to compress flows. Defaults to 4. Must not be greater than the number of
cores online. Useful for higher levels of compression for lz4 or zstd and large amount of flows per second.
Please not, -W affects only writing flows.
.It Fl J Ar compress
Change compression for any number of files given by option
.Fl r Ar flowpath
Set 
.Ar compress
to 0 for no compression or to any of: 1 or LZO, 2 or BZ2, 3 or LZ4. This option may be used
for archiving flow files and changing the compression to use less disk space.
.It Fl X
Compiles the
.Ar filter
syntax and dumps the filter engine table to stdout. This is for debugging purpose only.
.It Fl Z
Check
.Ar filter
syntax and exit. Sets the return value accordingly.
.It Fl R Ar filelist
Select a range of files. This option is mainly used by old NfSen and documented here
as legacy option.
.Bl -item -compact
.It
/any/dir          Read recursively all files in directory dir.
.It
/dir/file         Read all files beginning with file.
.It
/dir/file1:file2  Read all files from file1 to file2.
.El
When using in combination with a sub hierarchy:
/dir/sub1/sub2/file1:sub3/sub4/file2
Read all files from sub1/sub2/file1 sub3/sub4/file2 iterating over all required hierarchy levels.
Note: files are read in alphabetical order.
.It Fl M Ar dirlist
Read the same file hierarchy from multiple directories. This option is mainly used by
old NfSen and documented here as legacy option.
Example: /any/path/to/dir1:dir2:dir3 etc. and will be expanded to the directories:
/any/path/to/dir1, /any/path/to/dir2 and /any/path/to/dir3. Any number of colon separated
directories may be given. A path ending with a wildcard '@' such as /any/path/to@ will
expand automatically in a list of all existing sub directories /any/path/to/dir1:dir2:dir3.
The files to read are specified by -r or -R and are expected to
exist in all the given directories. The options -r and -R must not contain any directories
when used in combination with -M.
.It Fl T
Tag IP addresses with a prepending cntrl-A character, to allow output parsers to hook in.
This option is mainly used by old NfSen and documented here as legacy option.
.It Fl V
Print
.Nm
version and exit.
.It Fl h
Print help text on stdout with all options and exit.
.El
.Pp
.Ar filter
selects, which records will be further processed. If no filter is given, all
records will be processed. Otherwise, only those flows matching the filter
will be processed. Any IP address in a filter may be specified as IPv4 or IPv6.
.Pp
The filter syntax is similar to tcpdump but adapted and extended for flow records.
The filter can be either specified on the command line after all options or in a
separate file. It can span several lines. Anything after a '#' is treated as a
comment and ignored to the end of the line. There is virtually no limit in the
length of the filter expression. All keywords are case insensitive.
.Pp
A single filter primitive filters a single element of a flow record.
A filter consists of one or more primitives, which are linked together:
.Pp
.Dl Ar expr Sy and Ar expr
.Dl Ar expr Sy or Ar expr
.Dl Sy not Ar expr Sy and Ar (expr)
.Pp
In all expressions, where a
.Ar number
is a valid argument, the
.Ar number
may be given as a normal decimal number or as a hex number prefixed by
.Sy 0x
such as
.Sy 0x22.
A decimal number may also contain a multiplication factor such as
.Ar K, M, G, T
which multiplies the number by the corresponding factor. For example
.Ar 1K, 2G etc.
.Pp
String arguments may be single or double quoted or not quoted at all,
if the string is not a reserved filter key word - 
.Sy src geo CH
but
.Sy src geo 'IN'
.Pp
Possible filter primitives:
.Bl -tag -width "## spacer       ##" -compact
.It Cm @include Ar file
Expands the content of
.Ar file
into the current filter
.Pp
.It Cm count Ar comp number
True if the comparison with the record counter matches
.Ar number
Each record gets assigned a record number at the time it is
read from file. Therefore this record number is not unique and
may change, depending on the order files are read.
.It Cm ident Ar string
True if the record ident field matches
.Ar string.
This filter can be used to filter out different sources.
.Pp
.It Cm inet
.It Cm ipv4
True if source and destination IP of a record are IPv4 IPs.
.Pp
.It Cm inet6
.It Cm ipv6
True if source and destination IP of a record are IPv6 IPs.
.Pp
.It Cm min ttl Ar comp num
.It Cm max ttl Ar comp num
True if min/max IP ttl matches comparison.
.Pp
.It Cm ttl Ar comp num
True if min or max IP ttl matches comparison.
.Pp
.It Cm ttl equal
True if min and max IP ttl have the same value
.Pp
.It Cm proto Ar protocol
True if the record protocol field matches
.Ar protocol. protocol
can be a string such as
.Cm tcp ,
.Cm udp ,
.Cm icmp ,
.Cm ah ,
.Cm esp ,
.Cm ipip ,
and many more or a protocol number, such as 6, 17 for protocol
.Sy tcp
and
.Sy udp .
.Pp
.It Cm tun proto Ar protocol
True if the record tunnel protocol field matches
.Ar protocol. protocol may be a string or protocol number.
.Pp
.It Cm ip Ar ipaddr
.It Cm src ip Ar ipaddr
.It Cm dst ip Ar ipaddr
True if the respective IP field of the record matches
.Ar ipaddr . ipaddr
may be an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a symbolic hostname. In this case
a DNS lookup resolves the hostname to one or more IP addresses. If
more than one IP results, all IPs are chained together in an
.Cm or
chain. (IP or IP or IP).
If
.Cm ip
is not specified with
.Cm src
or
.Cm dst
the source or destination IP may match. If 
.Ar ipaddr
is set to
.Cm tor
then flows are listed, if the respective ip addr is a to tor exit not. For this filter
to work, you need a working nftordb. 
.It Cm host Ar ipaddr
.Cm host
is just a synonym for
.Cm ip
(See above)
.Pp
.It Cm ip in Ar [ iplist ]
.It Cm src in ip Ar [ iplist ]

.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
This section describes how output formats are compiled.
.Nm
has a lot of already pre-defined output formats such as
.Ar raw, json, ndjson, csv
etc. One line formats supplied with option
.Fl o
can be compiled from various elements of a flow record. As a flow record contains many different
elements it is often useful to compile an output format for specific needs.
.Pp
.Ss Format description
The output format is specified by
.Cm -o Do fmt: Ar string Dc
for line output or
.Cm -o Do csv: Ar string Dc
for csv output.
.Ar String
contains the field
.Ar tags
to be printed as well as other characters if needed. A
.Ar tag
starts with a
.Cm %
sign followed by the field name.
.Ar tags
are separated by spaces for line format or by ',' for csv format. Characters or other strings, not starting with a
.Cm %
sign are copied literally to the output.
.Pp
Example:
.Dl Fl o Do fmt:%ts %td %pr %sap -> %dap %pkt %byt %fl Dc
.Dl Fl o Do csv:%ts,%td,%pr,%sa,%sp,%da,%dp,%pkt,%byt,%fl Dc
.Pp
The difference between
.Ar fmt
and
.Ar csv
is the printing of the header line. Furthermore 
.Ar csv
does not have a flow summary at the end. 
.Ar csv
output can be processed by any other post processing tool, which understands csv data.
The examples above show the definitions of the predined formats
.Cm line
and
.Cm csv.
It adds the elements
.Ar tstart duration protocol source IP address/port
followed by the literal characters -> and
.Ar destination ip address/port packets, bytes, flows
counter. Depending on the task, different output formats are required to see the required fields of
a flow record. You can either extend a predefined format or specify a new one at the command line.
.Pp
Example: Extend the predefined format
.Cm long
with the the IP address of the sending router
.Dl Fl o Do fmt:%long %ra Dc
.Pp
Predefined formats can be extended by simply add their name with a
.Cm %
sign somewhere in the format string. As described under the output option
.Fl o
.Pp
.Ss Format definition
.Nm
has already many formats predefined. Most of the time, these format are good enough. Sometimes
you may need different formats, which can be compiled as described above. In order to prevent
adding the same often used output format each time you run
.Nm
a new output format may be define in the config file
.Ar nfdump.conf
The file
nfdump.conf.dist
contains the definition of the already hard coded formats. These may be uncommented and changed
according to the specific needs. New formats may be added using the following syntax:
.Pp
.Dl fmt.newname = Do fmt:%ts %td %pr %sap -> %dap %pkt %byt %fl Dc
.Pp
with
.Ar newname
any new or existing definition of output formats. Existing formats are overwritten with the
new definition. You may also define a custom csv output format such as:
.Pp
.Dl csv.newname = Do csv:%tsr,%ter,%pr,%sa,%sp,%da,%dp,%pkt,%byt,%fl Dc
.Pp
Please note, that
.Ar newname
must be unique for all formats in
.Ar fmt
as well as 
.Ar csv
.Ss Tag definition
The following list contains all tags, which are available to compile the output format:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "##    ##" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm %<format>

.Sh EXAMPLES
.Nm
processes files created by any previous version of nfdump 1.6.x with some limitations
for versions < 1.6.17. In order to convert flow files to the new 1.7.x binary format
use the following command to read//write files:
.Pp
.Dl % nfdump -r oldfile -w newfile
.Pp
Print a statistic about the top 20 IP addresses, once sorted by flows and once by bytes
.Pp
.Dl % nfdump -r flowfile -s ip/flows/bytes -n 20
.Pp
Print two statistics, one about the source IP and one about the destination IP address
limited to flow with either source or destination port 443
.Pp
.Dl % nfdump -r flowfile -s srcip/bytes -s dstip/bytes -n 20 'port 443'
.Pp
Print a statistic about the IP pairs, which exchanged most traffic.
.Pp
.Dl % nfdump -r flowfile -s record/bytes -A srcip,dstip
.Pp
Print all flows in raw format with a HTTP header in the payload even if flow is not on port 80.
.Pp
.Dl % nfdump -r flowfile -o raw Do payload regex 'GET|POST' Dc
.Pp
Print a statistic about all ja3 md5 sums for those flows, which a valid ja3 can be calculated
.Pp
.Dl % nfdump -r flowfile -s ja5 -n 0 'payload ja3 defined'
.Pp
Aggregate all flows and write the result back to a binary file, sorted by the start time
.Pp
.Dl % nfdump -r flowfile -a -Otstart -w newfile
